    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mexican birria tacos, Jalisco-style, made with braised beef that's slow-cooked in a fragrant 3-chile sauce with a delicious spice mix. Crispy tacos, and tender, mouth-watering beef team up with melted Mexican cheese in this impressive meal. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 dried guajillo chile peppers, seeded</li>
        <li>4 dried chile de arbol peppers, stemmed and seeded</li>
        <li>2 dried ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>4 medium Roma tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Fill a pot with water and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Start the sauce: Add guajillo, arbol, and ancho chile peppers to the boiling water; boil for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pot from the heat and allow peppers to soak until cool. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, sear the meat: Rinse beef and pat dry with paper towels. Cut beef into chunks if desired, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
    </ol>
